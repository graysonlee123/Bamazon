## Usage

You can "purchase" items to update the database. 

The manager view can be accessed by going to [/manager](https://murmuring-fortress-49853.herokuapp.com/manager), and the supervisor view can be accessed by going to [/supervisor](https://murmuring-fortress-49853.herokuapp.com/supervisor).

The manager can edit products, while the supervisor can edit departments. Deleting a department will delete all products in the department.
